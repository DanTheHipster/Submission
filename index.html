<h1>How To Get an Apprenticeship!</h1>  
<hr>
<h2>Build a Portfolio!</h2>
<ol>
<li>Start by by introducing yourself, something short but informative will work. <br>
    I recommend starting with something like <a href="./About Me.html">this!</a>
</li>
<br>
<li> After you have introduced yourself, now you can show
    some of your works! Upload some of your works to show your
employer like I did <a href="./Collection of works.html">here!</a>
<br>
<br>

<h1>AND........</h1>
<h2>Sell yourself.</h2>
    <p>I understand that you guys take risks as you guys take on 
    apprenticeships. It is a gamble on whether or not it will be worth your time 
    or your money. I respect whatever decision you guys come to. <br>
    I will make a career out of this one way or another. I appreciate you guys checking this out!
